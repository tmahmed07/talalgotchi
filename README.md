## Installation
The talalgotchi uses an Arduino Uno, breadboard, small 128x64 I2C oled display, 3 pushbuttons, and 12 wires. For wiring, connect your Arduino's power (3.3V) and ground to the breadboard, then connect the power and ground rails to the GND and VCC pins on the display. Further, connect the SCL pin on the display to A5 on the Arduino, and SDA on the display to A4 on the Arduino. For the buttons, connect three push buttons to ground. Then connect the right button to pin 2 on the digital input side, the middle button to pin 3, and the left button to pin 4.
